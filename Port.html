        <h1>My career So Far</h1>

        <p class="bio-text">
            I have had the opportunity of doing internships at two well-known companies
            in my country,and its been nothing short of amazing. Going into the tech industry,<br>
            i have had to adjust and double my efforts in order to reach my target 
            goals which has helped me to have a clear picture of what my path in this
            industry will look like. <br> As an aspiring software developer being able to 
            learn coding and also know how to run the code and edit a few tags has been
            my goal. <br>  To top it all am now a scholar of Stutern which is the beginning of 
            my great tech career.
